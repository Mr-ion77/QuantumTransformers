QCircuit_No_Attention_Selection refers to the standard architecture in witch all patches are forwarded to the quantum circuit.
Hyperparameters: attention_selection = False

QCircuit_only_selected_patches refers to an architecture in which patches NOT selected by the attention mechanism dont go through any perceptron, quantum or vanilla.
Hyperparameters: attention_selection = True, filter_by_attention = True

QCircuit_plus_Normal_MLP refers to an architecture in which patches NOT selected by the attention mechanism go through a vanilla perceptron.
Hyperparameters: attention_selection = True, filter_by_attention = False, mlp_only_quant = False

QCircuit_plus_Identity refers to an architecture in which patches NOT selected by the attention mechanism are forwarded through an Identity to the next transformer block.
Hyperparameters: attention_selection = True, filter_by_attention = False, mlp_only_quant = True
